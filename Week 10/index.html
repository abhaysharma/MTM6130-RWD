			<h2>HTML Forms</h2>
			<!--
			Forms require two things to be valid:
				the 'action' - where the data goes when the user hits submit
				the 'method' - how the data gets there
					the 'get' method sends data via the query string (by adding it to the end of your address in the browser)
					the 'post' method sends a little piece of encrypted data along to the server
			-->
			<form id="htmlForm" action="somephppage.php" method="get">
				<div>
					<!--
						all form fields should have a label associated with them - the 'for' attribute of the label should match the 'id' of the form field.
						when you click on the label, you activate the form field (really obvious with checkboxes, but basically means you start typing in a text field).
					-->
					<label for="firstName">First Name: </label>
					<!--
						the 'input' field can have many different types - text allows your user to enter a single line of text
						all form fields should have a name attribute, which the server uses to figure out which field the data is from
					-->
					<input type="text" name="firstName" id="firstName" placeholder="James" required value="Mr.">
					<!--
						the placeholder attribute adds text that disappears when the user starts typing
						the required attribute will force your browser to not submit unless the user has entered something in the field (it doesn't need a value)
						maxlength will limit the number of characters the user can type
					-->
				</div>
				<div>
					<label for="lastName">Last Name: </label>
					<!-- 
					value is the actual contents of the field (what the user typed), but you can use it to put contents into the field.  it overrides the placeholder
					-->
					<input type="text" name="lastName" id="lastName" placeholder="Bond" maxlength="20">
				</div>
				
				<div>
				   <label for="pass">Password: </label>
					<!-- the password field is like the text field, but hides the content being added and shows only bullets -->
				   <input type="password" name="pass" id="pass">
				</div>
				
				<div>
					<!-- the text area allows for a multi-line submission.  it can be resized by the user (which sometimes screws up your design) -->
					<label for="summary">Summary: </label>
					<textarea name="summary" id="summary"></textarea>
					<!-- the text area is a little different from other form elements - whatever you type inbetween the open and close tags will show up inside the field, including white space - so, if there is nothing to start in your text area, don't leave any space between the tags -->
				</div>
				
				<!-- the fieldset segments a section of your form - in addition to drawing a nice box around it, it also means you can access these fields as an array on the server -->
				<fieldset>
					<!-- the fieldset can have a legend, which puts a title in the border -->
					<legend>Select Our Free Services</legend>
					
					<div>
						<!-- the checkbox is exactly what it says it is -->
						<label for="spam">Spam me forever: <input type="checkbox" name="spam" id="spam"></label>
						<!-- with labels, you can also surround the field and a piece of text with the label to directly associate that label with the field -->
						<label for="sell">Sell all my information: <input type="checkbox" name="sell" id="sell" checked></label>
						<!-- if you want to start a checkbox off checked, give it the attribute checked (if you don't want it to start checked, don't give it the attribute) -->
					</div>

					</label>
					<!-- it is the name that links radio buttons together - all radio buttons in a set have to have the same name, so our ids have to be different in this case
					radio buttons should have a value attribute, so the server knows which button you have selected (and you can do something about it) -->
					
				</div>
				
				<div>
					<label for="favFood">Fav. Food:</label>
					<!-- the dropdown menu is called select - a label here is not necessary, but you can have one if you want -->
					<select name="favFood" id="favFood" multiple>

						<optgroup label="Dessert">
							<option value="cc">Cheese Cake</option>
							<option value="ic" selected>Ice Cream</option>
							<option value="rc">Rum Cake</option>
						</optgroup>
						<!-- the value, usually a code of some kind, will be used by the server to process this info - while the text is what the user actually sees 
						the selected attribute will start one item as selected (by default, the first item starts as selected) -->

							<option value="gc">Grilled Cheese</option>
