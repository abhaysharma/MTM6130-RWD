                <!-- 
                Navigation in its basic form is list of links to other pages of the website, which helps users to navigate through our site
                To give the links a semantical meaning we use nav tag
                since it is a list of links we add a ul tag to give it a structure, also li is a block level element and helps to display one anchor per line
                -->
